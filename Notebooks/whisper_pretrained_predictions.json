and i didn't give my opinion no mind and i just jumped inside the taxi. i jumped inside the taxi. the taxi man asked me where i was going. i told the taxi man i was going because the taxi is the taxi man and i tell you campbell he can't be the camera villain until i stop off at the corner i actually how much should it drop he saw me she won't pay me and now i really irritated because he asked him me how much you want pain like are you supposed to get a fixed rate for tell me what is it you want me to pay who is it is due to you anyway i actually again how much is the job is how much you want me i tell you 500 you know the man had the other people tell me that oh oh you can't pay no 500 for this job and look how long and how far i can collect you mind you he collect me from border he collect me from border why anyway so we continue talking gaff and i tell you well you tell me how much i should pay you i think i should pay you 500 since you can't make up your mind on what you want me to pay he said all right i'll take take you $500 i could collect your number i said no me giving away me number and i went inside um to where i had to go and the man stopped writing and carrying her anyway another time i drive in with a taxi i can't travel with a taxi the man used to pick me up before i go for buy fruits i go for buy fruits from a nearby and i went to church and i go for buy fruits from a nearby car or a nearby stand the taxi man know me from a long long long he know me from seeing me about the place and couple of time i go and travel with him. anyway i travel with the man and i said look i gotta buy something but he said hurry up quick the man gonna drop off another set of people that he gonna pick up from church and he never tell me he has to go and pick up. i said alright no problem he go he pick up the people then and he went to drop the man first because some people kind of irritated that i was inside the bus in the first in the taxi sorry for the first place. so i said okay went and pick up another person after he went and dropped off these people at this point i little irritated because i could have just by my fruits and i would have walk home and still meet before anyway the man went and he dealing with this that everything and i tell him you know how um you know like you know take me home and the man said it all oh yeah just hold on i'm drop off this man's echoes and then everything you know if i echo said from where you got home and then the master asked him about how you know if you're driving you know for drivers i know i don't know how to drive i um i gotta learn though i just write in the roadway forever and the man got familiar you know i think the road is driving thing easy and wherever he started cloning me and i started coming before um he said oh i can teach you how to drive i did drop a drive at this point i'm just like i just want to go home and me better burning bad because look how long i supposed to eat something look how long i supposed to deal with myself when i go home eat my fruits prepare something cook something for tomorrow um lunch walking out and things up and this man only carrying on about i can teach you for driving i teach you for drive anyway the man is the one taking by durban park to teach me for dry i said okay and he showed me what to do with such here so all right time to go home now the man step out the car tell me to go behind the wheel and to go and drive. i said huh? are you laughing me on for driving? he said yeah it's easier, i'll show you what to do. go on and drive. i said okay, i don't want to go behind the wheel. i use the instructions that he gave me to go and drive. i drive, i drive, spin, i swear to the car. me know what i'm doing but over time i catch myself and i be doing really good and the master alright he was in the front seat the whole time the master alright look since you could drive with me in the car you see how you just drive with me outside the car i just found him like it's an hour since i was supposed to be home you got me here and you got me inside this car for making myself i thought that good because me come to meet my dad the master look you can be alright i just show you what you do see you and step out of the vehicle he stepped out of the vehicle and he got excited and he showed me what to do mind me mind you people come and pass will know he and they went and they tell you that oh you're training this girl and they're laughing and me i hope them and think that me and he is anything he just showed me as a random taxi man anyway i went and he turned me he turned me for reverse i have to go forward i have to turn and help to straighten the wheel and everything straightening really hard let me tell you very very hard i do my best all the time to straighten the weave and you just keep going and telling me look this and that you need to think it through and stay in the weave and i believe that i need to stay in the weave and everything but it's so hard right and i try to use the mirror but same time i try to watch you same time i try to watch what you are doing same time i try to watch my phone to see if the phone catching me retiring because i know i gotta i'm gonna lie about this. yeah, but that's all i gotta talk about. what kind of foods do you like? sometimes i just think about guys who cook up and they're not in g and the curry. by the time i try it for my curry, by, i'm licking myself with the curry. i put too much spice inside this curry. nobody ever tell me that is always you watch. i got home with myself and watch youtube video and try and make it. same thing i do with a cook up. by the time i make a cook up, i make a cook up so good. i'm not gonna lie about this. i'm not gonna lie about this. make a cook up and make a cook up so good it had peas it had everything except this but i forgot to put the salt inside this cook up and i served it up nice nice presentation one onion and i go and put steamed greens on the side and potato and chicken and salt and i left it and it looked real nice but look by the time i stand up it tastes horrible mama says society is real nice, so i'm not speaking up about myself, but anyway, it does not define a lot of directions when it comes to cooking. i can use food, i can use the best food i could, but i would rather cook for other people and taste the representation i'm given. look. anyway, this is all i'm going to get off of now."

        "hyp": " hey, so the trip we had over the weekend to the pomeroon, right? roxanna wasn't gonna go because she had to go overseas, but the people cancel and so she ended up going which is pretty good because you know me and i is give x for those like the most literal it's not insignificant but the littlest stuff from people's mommy here stripping i like the guy from you g, right? he's ready to leave he's a driver and this man is get vexed like vex vex when once you go off time and the people who supposedly join us for the future from the other class and meet up to now it's time for us to go it's like 6 30 and they didn't meet we had to sit down and wait and this man this man get vexed right and like because he knows me he talking to me and i'm like these are the classmates i literally have to go and sleep overnight with in a strange place so like i won't get him vexed i won't get them vexed anywho so we finally meet perica like very very late but why i didn't realize that the bus was going on the ferry and the the rule is you're supposed to be there three hours before which means technically the bus could have go on and then we come later but you know and everybody got their own private transportation so that's how come we ended up having to meet that campus in the morning and then going over on the boat now if you hear this snide remarks girl if roxana wasn't there i would get canceled because i i cannot handle how some of these people's behave like they're so rude and disrespectful and like low life low key just low life and it's crazy because you can't be inconveniencing people and then won't give x that's crazy anyway we finally get up there it's me roxana zane and lydia like we just this is our group for the assignment and we kind of sticking together because well i had to tell you about the cheating story and how the rest of people in class they kind of behave you know how anyways we get up there finally like we stop in at uh under regina for lunch and then we finally get to the place on the pomerun it's on the pomerun river like really really down it's a satellite village right so we finally get there 5 13 afternoon the place we were supposed to stay they didn't have the keys and then we go to the village to show to get the keys and then we ended up staying in the school and when i walk up to this school building right i'm thinking like something is here but like like a spirit or something but it didn't make sense for two reasons why one was my anxiety and the second one was nobody else being bothered by it so i just dismiss it but like in the afternoon sorry nighttime now i'm going like trying to sleep this is around eight o'clock i've fallen asleep waking up back falling asleep waking up back and nobody else is having like any kind of trouble sleeping there on the phone there's that the other right so i finally go outside me uh this girl maquisa uh zane what the other guy name and the lecturer right we're looking at the constellation stuff it honestly reminded me so much of the astronomy days with us and like camp and meeting up on campus and stuff with the telescopes and i miss that so much and it was just this really bittersweet moment because i'm able to share this information with like new people but i honestly miss our old group i miss us meeting up so often i miss it's just like the community that we had at the astronomy club and i'm so sorry like for what happened now uh like because there's there's been no meetings in forever there's the interim management committee but that they haven't really been doing anything and it's just it's sad to know that we put in so much time and effort and like energy into this and now it's just nothing but the thing is if we were to we weren't treated properly and there were a lot of ups and downs but if we were to go back now and just take over what's gonna happen when we graduate like the same thing will happen again and i don't want them not wasting any more energy but anyway back to nighttime now till 11 o'clock i go back in and i wake up 12 o'clock i wake up three o'clock i wake up four o'clock i sit up i'm on my phone i like answering messages and that's when i saw your message and that's when i replied and then like in the morning now later in the morning six o'clock when everybody waking up like everybody tired and groggy and nobody sleep good the same girl who was outside with me till 11 o'clock she told me when she come in she couldn't sleep like the same fall asleep thing it wasn't happening for her and roxana told me how she get up four o'clock in the morning and watch me on my phone i didn't even know she was up and like everybody just had a really really hard time sleeping and which makes me wonder like these we are people who would sleep through the night and you know really and truly maybe there was something like some spirit or something bothering us because i ain't getting any other kind of explanation but anyway we use the washroom get ready people bathe and stuff and then we went to the forest concession it was actually a pretty nice hike and nothing can compare it honestly to how bad it was when we got lost in synchro position because that was me my sister my dad and two of the workers that were kind of supposed to develop the land we walked for a mile in the wrong direction i fall down in razor grass i cut my cheek i cut my hand so after that and the thing is i was wearing long boots too and i was like much thinner i was much younger as well so i didn't have like the muscle mass that i do now and like we just the the forest concession on friday it was not friday which day was it sunday that was the sunday right and it was pretty nice you know the the ground wasn't too uneven i stayed far away from the razor grass so that was good uh they had the to shout and the other um guy from like the forest he used to work at a forestry commission and like they do work in forest concessions so we learned a lot we learned about like the tagging system and how they're preventing illegal mining and so so it was pretty nice and then we come back to we come back to se kribble girl is actually like the billboards of the like for the ad that we shot with exxon mobile uh for the astronomy club it's it's like i saw three and three different locations and it's just it's so surreal to me like why is my head and like enlarged and on a billboard that that's crazy to me honestly like i'm thankful for the opportunity but my head bro my head's just there i don't know by the time we get back on the west coast because we had to take the ferry again and that was long long but um the there was traffic on the west coast we meet home i meet home till 7 30 and um roxana was with me because she wasn't getting a taxi until like something tonight she actually got the taxi to go home and then by the time i go upstairs now you know you got unpacked because you can't really unpack with when when you're entertaining guess how you're eating dinner and so so by the time i actually went to sleep after i showered and stuff was midnight and then i honestly thought the lecture would have canceled class but we didn't have that many classes for him this semester because he's really chill so we just like i think it was 8 30 in the morning 8 39 we had a short session because we had the test on wednesday for him and yeah it was it was pretty simple man and that was the weekend that was the weekend i'm still exhausted thank you."

        "hyp": " i'm there on campus here, waiting on my sister to finish her exam. she told me she didn't take less than half an hour, but we've been here for a while. i went over to the library trying to find one of these past students' papers, but they ain't got it. and i gotta work on this literature review. i gotta message my mentor. the mentor that the faculty assigned to me for this research proposal was on bereavement leave, so i'm way, way, way behind on the rest of my classmates. and then a lecturer wants it and one of the other lecture wants a status update she won the um the title objectives methodology and the literature review for the 19th but they had they had a little problem with it because the way she worried the exam is the email sorry is that she won the entire thing must be presented on the 19th but she put a literature review for the 23rd but apparently when we asked how the lecture is just a status update but in my head now i gotta finish all of this thing for the 19th already even though i know otherwise i but you know i figured the earlier i finish it the better and we have this exam on wednesday at the career day right um on saturday it wasn't sunday yeah on saturday because the first day was friday and i went with acela and we just walk around we walked to the different booths and stuff but on on that night time the lecturers uh requested uh more volunteers for the next day but there were actually less volunteers that day so i'm glad that i went because they were really on the staff anyway so i said i would help them volunteer i ended up manning the water quality testing station and i talked so much because you know as one set of stuff you have to repeat over and over again like i was standing up from literally 10 to 3 in the afternoon and my feet kind of swell but um one of the lecturers right he was talking to a set of students and like bringing them through the different booths and stuff and he was like and this is miss hussein one of my top students and in my head i'm like all right sir i hope i hope the grades you give me reflect that statement um he told us to focus on the ipcc report and a few of the physics laws i don't even know as well at this point i know just some fancy laws which i gotta go and cram into my head because this is an on-campus test and he won't give me essay type questions which is insane to me because in no way you're writing five essay questions each for 20 marks in two hours you need more time than that and he just anyway hoping for the best hoping and i'm one of his top students like he claimed let's hope that a subtle foreshadowing my sister hasn't come out of her test as yet i'm just waiting here in the parking lot i am sweating because i park in the sun and there's so much other places i'm sorry like all the other parking spaces in the spot as well and yeah you can tell that i haven't slept good as well because i keep on like repeating myself and i keep on stammering and i'm just glad we don't have to do any kind of presentation or so in class because i cannot talk fluently when i'm sleep deprived and honestly i wanted to make so roxanna's mom made this thing one time where she took shrimp and coconut and mushrooms like she made this soup and i wanted to make this thing today and then i'm like wait no because i wanted to use the big prawns and we didn't have any more the big prawns in the freezer so we gotta wait till saturday to go market and buy that and i don't know where i'm going to find the mushrooms from honestly but i just i know i want eat this thing you know when you're fasting all different kind of thing you just want to eat but the thing is once you break your fast once you drink a little water and eat them dates you just don't want anything else really so that's how i've been i've just been craving things during the day and in one night time come i have like either no appetite or i just don't want it anymore last night i ate some school ones that been in the fridge i had some biryani chicken and i bought rice from a sealer's mom and that was it i had tortillas since last weekend i wanted to eat i have this tuna fish thing there's biryani chana they also got like the different juices and stuff that my dad bought but i'm honestly not craving anything so i don't know exactly i mean i hope i'm getting enough nutrients and i'm staying away from coffee because you saw what happened with me with a coffee the other night like my feet were cramping i don't know how i feel like i'm just thankful when i felt i didn't twist my ankle because that would have been bad we had a long way to walk to the car and it's just you know i think everything's just so confusing right now i'm just trying to get through the week i think we're having a next uh field trip this weekend and i ain't even unpacked properly i ain't even washed like some of the outfits that i used last weekend so i don't want the next two weeks to pass and i ain't do laundry because last time i did that that was crazy because that was january and like every day we were going out because some of my friends were in the country so you know he's going to dinner he's going to the cinemas this that the other and i didn't wash clothes for two weeks and then i end up having to wear my sister's clothes and go over the next."

        "hyp": " right, so i just saw that you were asking for the voice notes on your story. i completely forgot about that. anyways, i shall try my best to deliver voice notes to you. i don't even know if this really even counts as like creole. because i feel like i don't even really speak that much creole. i just, i don't even know what i speak. like it comes out sometimes, randomly when i'm talking with like my mom or my dad. or like if i'm with like friends or something like really close friends and it would like come out but for some reason when i'm talking like this when i'm like explaining stuff like this i don't that don't even matter that don't even matter you asked for voice notes talking about anything and you shall receive voice notes of me talking about anything right so first thing that we're gonna cover today is um i've been working on this project right because i realized um i realized like three years into yuji that i really don't even really like coding like that right i want to um i want to focus more on art because that's something that i really like because you know i'm a creative person and um i don't really have a lot of art stuff uh because i i kind of destroyed them a while back um because i did visual arts and my teacher sucked and i ended up hating art for like a good let's say three three years it was until like very recently that i actually started picking up art again and liking art so i'm like doing it now right and i realized um i want to apply to do like art for my master's because i don't really want to do a bachelor's again because that's like four years of my life and i really don't feel like doing that so i'm going to do like a master's and the thing is because i'm doing computer science i don't know if they're even going to accept me for a master's in like art and animation specifically game art and animation because i still want to work on games that's like my ultimate career goal so like the plan the plan is the plan is using the time that i have left at ug but should be like two years i'm going to work on my portfolio my art portfolio and i'm gonna champak that full with art stuff problem is um i forgot all of my art skills in that time that i was not practicing so i have to like restart my art and that's a whole thing that i don't even want to get into because the actually i can get into it because we have the time right so i have zero art skills so i have to basically start from scratch and i've been practicing for like a while now i have to like go over all of the fundamentals from like the very start and i'm i'm better now like i'm getting the hang of it i'm doing art much better than i did when i actually started this whole um goal thing so that's good um but yeah back to what i was saying i was talking about the portfolio right so the plan for the portfolio is to jam-pack that full with a lot of art related stuff a lot of game art related stuff and hopefully when they see that they're like oh my god you know this is hopefully decent and you could like study this for your master's or whatever i don't even is that possible is it possible to like do your master's in art when you from like a completely unrelated field i i really don't know i probably should have researched that actually but it should be fine right because it's game art i don't know anyways right back to my portfolio so the problem that i'm having with my portfolio is i don't even really know what i'm gonna put inside of it like i've been working on art stuff but it's really just practice stuff it's a lot like sketches and stuff it's not like fully finished pieces of art you know what i mean and i don't want to put it in my i can't put it in my portfolio i have to put like proper stuff inside of my portfolio um so that's like a struggle i've been having and then this video comes across my youtube recommendations from this girl what was her name i think it was like d of d of an ish or something let me let me go find her name hold on right so her name is dpr oh my god this is so embarrassing debyoshri sarkar i feel like i just completely i feel so bad for this girl i'm so sorry debyoshri anyways nibiru shisakara on youtube she is a recently recent artist turned game developer um because she's much like me in some ways you don't even know what i'm talking about when i say she's just like me because you don't even have like enough context for that that statement anyways right she's a recently turned artist she's a recent artist turned game developer right and been following her game development process she's been doing pretty good actually i'm i'm really envious of like her art and stuff and the fact that she could just whip games up like that when i've been i've been trying to make a game for like a full game i know i did make a full game i've been trying to make full games for like a while like multiple full games because i want to add that to my portfolio but i can't i don't know i don't know i get stuck on like making the art and then stuff happens anyway so she made a video right called you need to play god once in a while right very interesting um title of the video caught me immediately and basically she was saying it was basically a a world building um video where she was saying you need to like start creating your own your own world where your characters with like intricate systems of government and currency and and politics and all of these different things and listen listen when i was younger that was my shit i used to do that every single week right i was making a new world up i was it was so intricate so detailed it was i loved making it and then somewhere along the line i just i just stopped you know and it it it hit something in me right i was like it's like i had this power for years and i never used it and then it clicked right it clicked i was like i can just use this world to make content for my portfolio right because i'm going to be doing two things at once i'm going to be generating content for my portfolio and i'm going to be making up a whole world that's just mine and i could like use it for like games and stuff right so after that realization hit i poured hours into world building into making this world which isn't even really finished yet it's not even it's not close to being finished yet all right i still have to get into the nitty-gritty details all of these things right anyways anyways all all seven minutes of that which is context for this world that i am now going to share with you right so this world is called iridia hold on let me open my notes let me get my notes open where is it hold on i'm like drawing and talking to you at the same time i'm listening to music this is like this is like adhd at its finest if if there was ever any doubt that i had adhd you won't have it after this right so um iridia iridia way way back in the day this is like a history lesson for iridia that i guess isn't even really that important like i doubt you don't really care anyway so back in the day this planet this world was ruled by gods these ancient gods and these gods were constantly fighting with each other like constantly fighting and they didn't have any boundaries right these were very much like olympus greek mythology type gods they just they're just mingling in human affairs and they making their problem everybody else problem and if humans are like please please just leave us alone just like go somewhere else and bother other people y'all y'all are like destroying our towns and our landscape and all of that over y'all petty wars and the gods are like no no no no we own this planet we could do whatever we want here y'all can't tell us anything and so they their whole war it was just like countless wars and people were suffering people didn't want them to like be fighting like that all the time and the reason they were fighting really was because they wanted to be like the supreme god right but then they'd fight and then someone would win and then that person would rule for like a couple years and then someone else is like you know what no fuck you i don't want to follow your rules anymore and then another fight would break out and it was just like constant fighting anyway so one day these beings come down from i don't even know where actually they just they just come onto earth and they put an end to all this fighting they sealed away all of the gods into like this nether realm and they said listen listen we're the gods now okay y'all don't even gotta worry about anything because we're in charge now we can make sure that what was happening before doesn't happen again right and so they come they stop the war people are like grateful they're like yeah yeah yeah whatever and these beings were called the celestials i need to find a better name for that for them because um i don't know if you know you wouldn't be able to tell um i pulled a lot of influence for these this world from genshin which has italier madoka magica and magus of the library and so you you a lot of things would seem very familiar if you know those things all right listen listen it's not like anybody can really be see in my world or anything and by that time if people do i'll have i'll have it more fleshed out but yes yes they're called the celestials right and after the celestials came and they stopped the fighting and so on they were like listen we don't want to be like the old gods where we're here and we're governing you and we're causing all this conflict and whatever we're gonna we're gonna leave y'all alone all right we're gonna go to like the celestial realm which is right above like the sky of this planet what like right there like it's right above yeah we're gonna go there and we're gonna let y'all govern yourselves essentially we're gonna appoint four leaders right and we're gonna in our seat in our absence these four leaders are gonna be like your your kings or whatever i don't even know your monarchs right and we're going to to decide uh how the planet is and all of that and like if you have any grievances or whatever you you go to them but we can we can like intercept every now and then to make sure everything is good and everything is chilling all right but at the end of the day y'all are responsible for y'all planet y'all do whatever y'all want with it peace and they left and oh before they left they gifted humanity magic we can get into the magic system a bit later but yeah so they left and they left the celestines to rule in their steed right and so the celestines there were four celestines one for each celestial and they essentially divided the planet up into four um each part was overseen by a celestial and each celestial would appoint high lords in those regions to watch over the regions with them so like the celestines watched over the end was in charge of the region though okay so they were in charge of the entire world basically right but they had their four regions that they were supposed to focus on but because they had a lot of stuff to do they would appoint high lords who would also kind of like how the celestials of the celestines they left the high lords to watch over that region for them right and each high lord would would report to a celestine and then the high lords would appoint magistrates or governors to watch over like smaller parts of that region so it was like a whole system of like governance going on down there we can we can also get into that a bit later right so these regions um none of the old gods and so on have been sealed there's like there's a lot more peace happening people are living in a lot more harmony of course you still have the like disharmonious people i don't know if that's not there there's still people that's so like disharmony and so on in the regions you know there's still racial discrimination and and all of that happening um but overall they're they're a lot more peace the celestines try their best to keep order in the in the country if people have if there's places that have a lot of like chaos and just bad stuff happening they try to resolve that because they really don't want another like you know like in the ancient times where it was just like they don't want that to happen again right so they they kind of want order but they're also low-key kind of corrupted because with wanting order they basically forced um people to follow like this one main religion they forced them to um follow their rules and all of that so while it is kind of um benefiting people like there is peace and well mostly peace mostly prosperity you know there are still people that don't agree with the celestines and all that whatever they're but yeah the celestines are all they're they're a little bit corrupt right and there there's there's some corruption happening in this world of course there is because we need conflict and a peaceful world is just boring we gotta we gotta get a little conflict and all of that right so on to the magic right because that was that was just like some context for iridi itself that was just some like backstory still gotta like go into like the nitty-gritty of iridium all anyways so the magic system right so i wanted this magic system to be kind of unique um hold on okay i gotta open another document for that thank you."

        "hyp": " all right, so the magic system. this, so this is kind of tricky. i don't have it completely fleshed out yet, but the one thing i knew going into making this magic system was i wanted it to be based on the concept of karma, right? your karmic destiny, the amount of power that you have in this world would be based on your karmic destiny, right? so we know the basics of karma, right? it means that your past actions in past lifetimes or whatever, they all influence your future, right? your future and your present. so your past actions influence your current life, your future life, and all of that jazz, right? so in this world, it follows the same basic concept. so you have your karmic destiny, your karmic weight, and it represents a spiritual and metaphysical impact that you have on the world, right? so your powers are basically influenced by your ambitions, by your actions, by your past actions in some sense. i'm not i'm not entirely sure if i want to have reincarnation as a concept in this world um it would kind of make sense if we're going the karmic route though to have reincarnation but i'm not sure i'm not too sure how reincarnation would work in this world considering i haven't developed like a heaven and hell or anything like that yet we're gonna see we're gonna see i know that people in the world believe in reincarnation but is reincarnation actually a thing i don't know yet i'll i'll i'll eventually get there anyways so your magic is influenced by your karmic weight so the magic itself was given as a gift to the humans from the celestials right the nitty-gritty of that i'm not really sure um i keep saying i'm not really sure but there's a lot of stuff that i haven't really fleshed out that much yet um especially because it's so like it's so much it's so complex i want the magic system to be one that's fully fleshed out to be one that that no matter what question you have it can't be answered by the magic system right so the magic was given to the people by the celestials and people who can use this magic are referred to as ethers or etherborns and only a very small percentage of the people in iridia can actually use magic it's not not everybody could actually use it it's not you wake up one day like oh no there's only a very very small percentage of people that can use magic and it's like that because of your because it's influenced by your karmic ways and karmic destiny because let's honestly you not everyone is gonna have a huge influence on the world not everyone is gonna be highly ambitious not everyone is gonna have that that change um that you want to see in the world right it's gonna be a small amount of people right so that's why there's only a very like a small percentage of people that actually can use magic even though everyone benefits from the magic like in a technical sense there is technology powered by magic in the world so non-ethers can use magic but they can't produce that magic themselves if you get what i'm saying right so there's a small potential to people that can actually all use magic but there is still a lot of ethers scattered throughout the world of erudia right because like well one percent of eight billion is still like a hundred million and some i don't know i don't know you're the max person i don't do max you you know the answer to that anyways right so the magic itself powered by karmic destiny magic use in erudia is governed by the celestine council which in turn is run by the celestines and while there is no strict laws and restrictions that govern the general use of magic the council still keeps a close eye on magic users especially if you are a magic user of a higher rank so within etherborns there are different ranks of them because you can have a small percentage of magic or you can have a high percentage of magic because again your power is based on your influence on your actions on your ambitions and all of that so if you're a highly ambitious person who is going to have a huge influence on the world then you're going to be extremely strong right and of course the council the solicitees are going to want to keep an eye on you because what do you mean you're very ambitious what do you mean you're going to have like this huge change in the world we gotta we gotta know what that means right i also wanted it to have like when i first came up of this world one thing that i also wanted was the concept of ascension where a person who has this magic if they are powerful enough they can eventually ascend and become a celestine i'm not sure if i'm gonna keep that though because that's like really tricky that's still like that's a really tricky concept because if you can become a celestine that means that the celestines die right so that means the celestines are in a sense mortal right and if the celestines are mortal what kind of beings really are the celestines you know what i mean like where do they come from how are they dying actually i don't think i even have to answer those questions yeah i don't have to answer you know what i'm not gonna answer it i'm just gonna i'm just gonna keep it up in the air an air of mystery so i might actually bring back the ascension because i really liked i really liked that whole concept of being able to ascend and eventually become um a celestial if you're powerful enough and all of that um but yeah so they're like the ether bars people who can use magic but they are also the bad people these are people called void mages so void mages do not fuck with celestials at all they don't like the celestials they think the celestials are a fraud because what do you mean you gifted us magic where is the magic coming from right oh another thing a very important thing that i forgot to to mention about the magic is when you use the the magic um when you die right your energy is harvested for use by the celestials that's like a big big thing with the magic that was like one of the first things i thought of when i came up with the magic system i don't know how i how i forgot to mention it but yeah so when you die when you're there's energy that's released upon your death and that energy is consumed by the celestial so the stronger your karmic weight is the more energy you produce upon death right and i think that all that would also tie into the reincarnation thing now that i think about it because if this energy is being consumed by the celestials then that means your soul can't even really die right you it have to it have to reincarnate or something along those lines i'll think about it later but yet to the celestials consume this energy but it can also be used by void mages so when you die the void mages can intercept that whole process and steal some of that energy from the dead person which makes void mages very dangerous right the void mages don't really like the celestials like i mentioned before they are worshippers of the old gods they believe that the celestials were in the wrong they believe that the celestials are hiding something because why did the celestials seal the gods away instead of killing them how did the celestials steal the gods away we don't know we do know that there are gods that are able to um speak with humans even from the nether realms like they're able to send humans messages and so on and those humans usually become void mages stuff like that right uh going back to magic use and it being kind of bad the more magic that you use as an ether the more side effects it has on your body prolonged exposure to the magic can cause a person's mind and body to slowly decay and corrupt that is crazy that is so crazy like the higher level of magic user that you are the more corrupt your body can become and they usually experience stuff like split personalities or time distortions the time distortion thing is really cool because okay so i don't think you did you watch shows what was it called hold on hold on right so in agatha all along there is this character called lilia lilia experiences time distortions or i think she does that's what i think she it seems to me that she discovered that she experiences time disorders so lilia's life she doesn't experience her life linearly she has moments where her mind jumps to different parts of her her life so one minute she's like five years old the next minute she's old she's in her like 30s or 40s and she doesn't like remember what she was doing before so like if she let's say you're you're here like time is linear it's on a line you're you know like time usually is or how people perceive time to be she's at one end of the line and then suddenly she's at the beginning and she doesn't even really know what happened she doesn't know how it happened she doesn't remember that time jump or anything like that so people usually view lilia as crazy because she they don't understand how her power works and she didn't really understand how it worked um but that's what i that's what i imagine when i say they experience time distortions is they have periods of times that they're just completely absent and then they come back and they don't remember what was going on it seemed like they were just a completely different person or something along that lines right so the more magic that you use the more it can decay your mind and decay your body sometimes you can even like distort your actual appearance like it could cause your like hands to become pitch black or it could cause you to grow extra limbs or horns or eyes or like all of these different crazy things right so using magic is inherently dangerous people still use it though because i mean it's magic right um but yeah so there are different types of magic users and there are different ranks of magic users like i like i said before i still have to come up with like names for the ranks it's like girl this thing is so much work like i want it to be so fleshed out and so detailed but also it's it's a lot of work to like sit down and think up of these things and like write them down and all of that because if i don't write them down then i'm gonna forget and all of that and uh it's like a lot but but it it will be worth it because i will be using this as inspiration for my art and so on like i'm gonna draw random people from the world and it's going to make sense because they're from somewhere um and it'll also help with like world building stuff and all of that um yeah so yeah i i've i've been really busy with this world um there's still a lot that i have to do in terms of fleshing stuff out and making i haven't made any characters for it yet uh because listen i lost my apple pencil yeah i did it was the same day that we went on yuji to make the pops i dropped it somewhere, i guess, on ug campus, and that was the end of that, right? so i have to get a new apple pencil. and until i get a new apple pencil, i can't really do that much art. i'm trying to do art with my regular pencil and my sketch pad, but it kind of sucks. i miss my tablet. i miss drawing on my tablet, you know? um but i still i'm still doing the traditional art because i mean i guess i have to i have to learn it right at some point like i have to know how to draw traditionally anyway so it's good practice um but yeah when i get back my apple pencil i'm gonna delve a bit more into like the art and i could start um some game design and so on because i want to make a game very soon i don't even know how i'm gonna do it because she's stressing me out i have a lot to do i got a test on thursday that i need to study for and then i have the bridge competition coming up that i haven't even started practicing for yet and then i have like dance practices on sundays i have the club stuff that i'm doing it's just it's just a lot man i'm tired yo i don't know i don't know one i'm gonna have time to really focus on this portfolio but i really should focus on it because it's very important and if i don't have a portfolio by the time i finish ug then i'm basically fucked because i can't apply for any colleges or anything like that and i want to i want to go straight from ug to doing my master's at an audio university that is the plan but we'll we'll see how that goes we'll see how that goes"

        "hyp": " when she was 14 years old, lois went on a canoe trip. she'd only been on overnights before. this was to be a long one, into the trackless wilderness, as kapi put it. it was lois's first canoe trip on her last. kapi was the head of the summer camp to which lois had been sent ever since she was nine. camp manitou, it was called. it was one of the better ones for girls, though not the best. girls of her age whose parents could afford it were routinely packed off to such camps which bore a generic resemblance to one another. they favored indian names and had hearty, energetic leaders who were called kapi, skip, or scotty. at these camps, you learned to swim well, and sail, and paddle a canoe, and perhaps ride a horse or play tennis. when you weren't doing these things, you would do arts and crafts and turn out dingy, lumpish clay ashtrays for your mother. mothers smoked more back then, or bracelets made of colored braided string. cheerfulness was required at all times, even at breakfast. loud shouting and banging of spoons on the table were allowed, and even encouraged at ritual intervals. chocolate bars were rationed to control tooth decay and pimples. at night, after supper, in the dining hall or outside around the mosquito-infested campfire ring for special treats, there were sing-songs. louis can still remember all the lyrics to my darling clementine and to my bonnie lies over the ocean, while with acting out gestures, a rippling of the hands for the ocean, two hands together under the cheek for lies. she will never be able to forget them, which is a sad thought. lois thinks she can recognize women who went to these camps and who were good at it. they have a hardness to their handshakes, even though a way of standing, legs planted firmly apart, further than usual, a way of sizing you up to see if you'd be any good in a canoe. the front, not the back. they themselves would be in the back. they would call it the stern. she knows that such camps still exist, although camp manitou does not. they are one of the few things that haven't changed much. they now offer copper enameling and functionless pieces of stained glass broken into electric ovens. though judging from the productions of her friend's grandchildren, their artistic standards have not improved. to lois, encountering it in the first year after the war, camp manitou seemed almost ancient. its log-sided buildings with the white cement in between the half-logs, its flagpole ringed with whitewashed stones, its weathered gray dock jutting out into lake prospect with its wooden rope bumpers and its rusty rings for tying up, its prim round floor bed of petunias near the office door must surely have been there always. in truth, it dated only from the first decade of the century. it had been founded by kapi's parents who thought of camping as bracing to the character, like cold showers, and had been passed along to her as an inheritance and an obligation. lois later realized that it must have been a struggle for cappy to keep camp manitou going during the depression and then during the war when money did not flow freely. if it had been a camp for the very rich instead of the merely well-off, there would have been fewer problems. but there must have been enough old girls, ones with daughters, to keep the thing in operation, though not entirely ship-shaped. furniture was battered, painted, trim was peeling, roofs leaked. there were dim photographs of these old girls dotted around the dining hall wearing ample woolen bathing suits and showing off their fat dimpled legs or standing arms intertwined in odd tennis outfits with baggy skirts."
