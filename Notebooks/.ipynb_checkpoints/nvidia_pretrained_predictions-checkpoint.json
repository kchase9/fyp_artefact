        "hyp": " hey, so the trip we had over the weekend to the palmer roon, right? ah, roxana wasn't going to go because she had to go overseas, but the people cancel and so she ended up going which is pretty good because you know me and i scarvs for the like the most literal is not insignificant, but the little less stuff when people's won't behave strip it. i like the guy from you, jerry. he's ready to leave he's a driver, and this man is get vexed, like vex vex when once you go off time. and the people who suppose they join us for the future from data claus, ain't meets up to know. it's time for us to go it's like six thirty and they and met we had to sit on and wait, and this man is man get vexed rate and like because he knows me he talkin' to me, and i these are the classmans i literally have to go and sleep over night with in a strange place or like i won't get him backs i won't get em vexed anyhow. shall we finally meet perica like very, very late. but why didn't realize it that the bus was going on the ferry and the the rule is you supposed to be there tree hours before, which means technically the bus could go on. and then we commanded it, but, you know, and not everybody got their own private transportation. so that's how commi ended up having to meet that compass in the morning, and then going over. on the boat now if you hear this night, remarks girl, if roxana wasn't there out to get consoled because i i cannot handle how some of these peoples behave like they're so rude and disrespectful and like low life. loki just low life and it's crazy 'cause you call me inconvenience in people and then wangex. that's crazy. anyway, we finally get up there it's me roxana, zane and lydia like we just this is our group for the assignment, and we kind of sicken together because well i'd tell you about the cheatin's story and how to rest people in classic i know behave, you know how. anyways we get up there finally like we stopping at a regina for lunch and then we finally get to the place in the pomeron is on the pomeroon river like really, really down as a satellite village rate. so we finally get their factory in afternoon, a place we were supposed to stay, they ain't had the keys. and now we go to the village to show to get the keys and then we ended up staying in school and when i walk up to this school building run i'm thinking like something is here, but like a spirit or something. but it didn't make sense for two reasons. why one was my anxiety, and the second one was nobody else being bothered by it. so i just dismiss it. but like in the afternoon sorry, night time now i'm going like trying to sleep as around eight o'clock i fallen asleep waken a back falling sleep waking up back. and nobody else is having like any kind of trouble sleeping day on if on this that the other, right. so i finally go outside me a this girl mcquisa a zane what do i name. i'm the lecturer, right. we look in at the constellation stuff. it honestly reminded me so much of a astronomy days with us and like camp and meeting up on compass and stuff with the telescopes, and i miss that so much and it was just this really richer sweet woman because i'm able to share this information with like new people, but i honestly miss our old group i miss us meeting up so often i missed just like the community that we had at the astronomy club and i'm so sorry like for what happened now because there's there's been no meetings in for ever there's the interim management committee but that they haven't really been doing anything and it's just it's sad to know that we put in so much time and effort and like energy into this, and now it's just nothing. but the thing is if we were to we weren't treated properly. and there were a lot of ups and downs, but if we were to go back now and just take over what's going to happen when we graduate like the same thing happened again and i don't want them not wasting any more energy. but anyway, back to night, i know, 'till you eleven o'clock i go back in. and i wake up twelve o'clock, i wake up three o'clock a week at four o'clock. i sit up i'm on my phone like answerin' messages, and that's when i saw your message, and that's when i replied. and then like in the mornin', no, later in the morning, six o'clock when everybody wakin' up like everybody tired and groggy and nobody sleep good. this same girl who was outside me 'til he eleven last, she told me when she come in. she couldn't asleep like the same fall in sleeping it wasn't happening for her. and roxana told me how she get up four o'clock in the mornin' and watch me on my phone. i didn't even know she was up and like everybody just had a really, really hard time sleeping, and which makes me wonder like these we are people who would sleep through to night. and in over the intrudly maybe there was something like some spirit or something botherin' us 'cause i get any other kind explanation. but anyway, we use a washroom get ready, people bade and stuff, and now we went to the forest concession. it was actually a pretty nice hike and nothing can comparis honestly to how bad it was when we got lost in sinco's position because that was me, my sister, my dad, and two of the workers i were kinda supposed to develop the land. we walk for a mile in the wrong direction. i follow, ain't raised a grass, i caught my cheek, i caught my hand. so after that the thing is i was wearing long boots too, and i was like much thinner i was much younger as well, so i didn't have like the muscle mass that i do know and like we just the of the farest concession on friday it was not friday which it was sunday, that was the sunday, right and it was pretty nice, you know, that the ground wasn't too uneven. i stayed far away from the rays of grass, so that was good. ah, they had the to show and the other, um, guy frog like the far shoot. he used to work in the fareshead commission, and like they do work in forest concessions. so we learned a lot we learn about like the tagin system, and how they're preventing illegal mining and so it was pretty nice and then we come back to we come back to x. quibble. the girl is actually like the billboard of the for the ad that we shop at x on mobile for the astronomy club. it's it's like i saw three untreat locations of school and it's just it's so surreal to me like why is my head and like enlarged and on a billboard. that's crazy to me, honestly like i'm thankful for the opportunity, but my head brew my head's just there. by the time we get back on the west coast because we had to take the ferry again. and that was long, long but, um, there was traffic on the west coast we meet home. i meet home till seven, hurt it and roxana was with me because she wasn't getting a taxi until like something to night she actually got the taxi to go home and by the time i go upstairs now you know you got unpacked because you can't really unpack with when you entertain and guess when you eatin' dinner and so. so by the time i actually went to sleep after i showered and stuff was midnight. and then i honestly got the lecture at a council class, but we didn't have that many classes for him this semester because you'd really chill, so we just like i think it was eight hurt in the morning, eight thirty nine we had a short session because we had the test on wednesday for him. and yeah, it was it was pretty simple, man and that was the weekend. that was the weekend, and i'm still exhausted."

        "hyp": " i dare encompass her a waiting on a sister finish her exam. she told me she'd take less than half an hour, but we bein' here for a while. i went over to the library trying to find one of these past students papers, but they ain't got it. and i'll work on this literature review a got message, my mentor. the mentor that the faculty assigned to me for this research proposal was on bereavement leave. so i'm way, way way behind on the rest of my classmates, and then a lecturer wants it and one of a lecturer wants a status update she wanted, um the title objectives methodology and the literature review for the nineteenth. but they had they had a little problem with it, because the way she wore the exam is the email, sorry, is that she wanted entire thing must be presented on the nineteenth, but she'll put a literature review for the twenty third. but a party won't be asked out a lecturers is just a status update, but in my head now i got finished all it is thing for the nineteenth already, even though i know otherwise i but you know i feared the earlier i finish it the better and we have this exam on wednesday at the career day, right, um, on saturday it wasn't sunday, yet on saturday 'cause the further's day was friday, and i went with a seala, and we just walk around we walked at the different boots and stuff. but on that night time the lecturers requested more volunteers for the next day. when they were actually less volunteers that day, so i'm glad that i went because they were really on the staff. anyway, so i said i would help them volunteer and ended up monin' the water quality testin' station and i talked so much because you know it's one set of stuff you have to repeat over and over again, like i was satin' up from literally ten to three in the afternoon, and my feet kind as well. but, um, one of the lecturers right. he was talking to a set of students and like bringing them through the different boots and stuff, and he was like, and this is miss hussein, one of my top students and in my hand like all right, sorry, i hope i hope the grades you give me reflect that statement. and, um he tell us to focus on the ipc report and a few of the physics laws. i don't even know as why at this point i know it was just some fancy laws, which i got going cramming to my head because this is an encompass test, and he won't give we essay type questions, which is insane to me because ain't no way you writin' five essay questions. each for twenty marks in two hours you need more time than that and he just anyway hoping for the best hoping on one of his top students, like he claimed. let's hope that was subtle for shadowing. my sister hasn't come autoptist as yet. i'm just waiting here in the parking lot. i am sweating because i park in the sun and there's so much other places i sorry, like all the auto parking spaces in the spot as well. i'm ye can tell that i haven't slept good as well because i keep on like repeating myself and i keep on stammering and i'm just glad we don't have to do any kind of presentation or so in class because i cannot talk fluently when i'm sleep deprived. and honestly i wanted to make so roxan as mom made this thing one time where she took shrimp and coconut and mushrooms like she made this soup, and i wanted to make this thing to day. i don't like wait no, because i wanted to use the big prawns, and we didn't have any more to bake prawns in the freezer. so we all wait till saturday to womarket and buy that and i don't know where i'm going to find the mushrooms from honestly. but i just i know i won't eat this and you know me fastened all different kind of things want to eat. but the thing is once you break if i'd want you drink a little water and eat them dates. you've don't want anything else really. so that's how i've been i've just been craving things during the day, and then one night i'm calm i have like eaten no appetite, or i just don't want it any more. last night i ate some schoolines of being in the fridge. i had some beriani chicken and i bought rice from a seala's mom. and that was it. i had torteas since last weekend i wanted to eat. i have this truna fish thing, there's beriani chana. they also got like the different juices and stuff and my diabout, but i'm honestly not cravin' anything. so i don't know exactly i mean, i hope i'm getting enough nutrients. and i'm staying away from coffee because you saw what happened with me with a coffee the other night. like my feet were cramping. i don't know how i flick i'm just done, but when i felt i didn't twist my uncle because now would have been bad we had a long way to walk to the car and it's just you know, i think everything's just so confusing right now just trying to get through the week. i think we're having a next, ah, field trip this weekend and i ain't even on pack properly, i ain't even washed it like some of the outfits that i used last weekend. so i don't want the next two weeks to pass and i ain't do laundry because last time i did that was crazy because that was january, and like every day we were going out 'cause some of my friends were in the country, so you know he's got to dinner he's go to the cinemas this dad theater, and i didn't wash clothes for two weeks, and then i end up having to wear my sister's clothes and gold and"

know if this really even counts as like creole, 'cause i feel like i don't even really speak that much, creole. i just i don't even know what i speak. like it comes out sometimes randomly what i'm talking with like my mom or my dad or like if i'm with, like, friends or something, like really close friends and it would like come out. but for some reason, what i'm talking like this, when i'm like explaining stuff like this, i don't that don't even matter. that don't even matter. you asked for voice notes talking about anything and you shall receive voice notes of me talking about anything. right, so the first thing that we're going to cover today is, um, i've been working on this project, right, because i realized, um i realized like three years into ug that i really don't even really like coding like that, right. i want to, um i want to focus more on art 'cause that's something that i really like 'cause, you know, i'm a creative person and, um, i don't really have a lot of art stuff, uh, because i i kind of destroyed them a while back, um 'cause i did visual arts and my teacher sucked and i ended up hating art for like a good let's say three, three years it was until like very recently i actually started picking up art again and liking art. so, i'm like doing it now, right and i realize, um, i want to apply to do like art for my masters 'cause i really want to work a bachelor's again because that's like four years of my life and i really don't feel like doing that. so i'm going to do like a master's and the thing is, because i'm doing computer science, i don't know if they're even going to accept me for a master's in like art and animation, specifically game art and animation because i still want to work on games. that's like my ultimate career goal, so like that the plan the plan is the plan is using the time that i have left i chee, which should be like two years i'm going to work on my portfolio my art portfolio. i'm going to jampack that full with art stuff. problem is um, i forgot all of my art skills in that time that i was not practising so i have to, like, restart my art and that's a whole thing that i don't even want to get into 'cause the actually i can get into it 'cause we have the time, right. so i have zero art skills i have to basically start from scratch and i've been practising for like a while now. i have to, like, go over all of the fundamentals from like the very start and i'm i'm better now, like, i'm getting the hand of it, i'm doing art much better than i did when i actually started this whole, um, go of thing so that's good. um, but yeah, back to what i was saying i was talking about the portfolio, right. so the plan for the portfolio is to jampack that full with a lot of art related stuff, a lot of game art related stuff and hopefully when they see that they're like, oh, my god, you know, this is hopefully decent and you could like study this for your masters or whatever. i don't even it's not possible. is it possible to, like, do your masters in art when you from like a completely unrelated field i i really don't know. i probably should have researched that actually, but it should be fine, right, 'cause it's game art i don't know. anyways, right, back to my portfolio. so the problem that i'm having with my portfolio is i don't even really know what i'm going to put inside of it. like i've been working on art stuff but it's really just practiced stuff is all like sketches and stuff, it's not like fully finished pieces of art, you know what i mean and i don't want to put it in my i can't put it in my portfolio. i've to put like proper stuff inside of my portfolio. um so that's like a struggle i've been having. and then this video comes across my youtube recommendations from this girl. oh, it's her name, i think it was like dio devonish or something let me go find her name. hold on right. so her name is diar oh, my god this is so embarrassing. the yoshri sarkar. i feel like i just completely i feel so bad with this girl i'm so sorry to ushery. anyways you wish you sarkar on youtube. she is a recently recent artist turned game developer, um because she's much like me in some ways. you don't even know what i'm talking about when i say she's just like me 'cause you don't even have like enough context for that statement. anyways, right, she's a recently turned artist. she's a recent artist turned game developer, right, and i've been following her game well friend process. she's been doing pretty good. actually i'm i'm really envious of, like, her art and stuff and the fact that she could just whip games up like that when i've been i've been trying to make a game for like a full game i know i did make a full game. i've been trying to make full games for, like, a while, like multiple full games 'cause i want to add that to my portfolio where i can. i don't know, i don't know. i guess stuff on like making art and then stuff happens anyway, so she made a video, right called you need to play god once in a while. right, very interesting, um, title of a video caught me immediately and basically she was saying it was basically a a world building, um video where she was saying, you need to like start creating room your own world where your characters were like intricate systems of government and currency and and politics and and all these different things and listen. listen. when i was younger that was my shit. i used to do that every single week, right. i was making a new world up. i was it was so intricate, so detailed, it was i loved making it and then somewhere along the line i just i just stopped, you know, and it it hit something in me. right. i was like it's like, i had this power for years and i never used it and then it clicked, right, it clicked. i was like i can just use this world to make content for my portfolio, right, 'cause i'm going to be doing two things at once i'm going to be generating content for my portfolio and i'm going to be making up a whole world that's just mine and i could like use it for, like, games and stuff, right. so after that realization hit i poured hours into world building, into making this world, which isn't even really finished yet. it's not even it's not close to being finished yet. all right, i still have to get into the meaty, greety details, all of these things, right anyways, anyways all seven minutes of that who's context for this world that i am now going to share with you, right, so. this world is called iridia. hold on, let me open my notes. i mean my notes open. where is it? well on i'm like drawing and talking to at the same time. i listen to music. this is like just like ehd as it's fines. if if there was ever any doubt that i had h, ad you won't have it after this, right. so um, iridia, iridia way way back in the day this is like a history lesson for iridia that i guess isn't even really that important like i doubt you don't really care anyway, so back in the day. this planet, this world was ruled by gods these ancient gods and these gods were constantly fighting in each other, like constantly fighting and they didn't have any boundaries, right. these were very much like olympus greek mythology type gods. they just they just minglin' in human affairs and they make in their problem, everybody else's problem and if humans are like, please, please just leave us alone just like go somewhere else and bought a lot of people. yaw you all are like destroying our towns and our landscape and all that over your petty wars and the gods are like, no, no, no, no we own this planet. we could do whatever we want here, you can't tell us anything and so they their whole war it was just like countless wars and people were suffering, people didn't want them to, like, be fighting like that all the time and the reason they were fighting really was because they wanted to be like the supreme god right. but then they'd fight and then someone would win and then that person would rule for, like, a couple of years and then someone else, like, you know, i don't buck you, i don't want to follow your rules anymore, then an art of kit would break on and it was just like constant fighting anyway so one day these beings come down from i don't even know where actually they just this come on to earth and they put an end to all this fighting. they seal the way all of the gods into like this never realm. and they said, listen, listen we're the gods now. okay, you don't even want to worry about anything 'cause we're in charge now we can make sure that what was happening before doesn't happen again, right, and so they come they stopped the war. people are like grateful they're like yea, yea ye whatever and these beings were called the celestials. i need to find a better name for that for them because, um i don't know if you know, you wouldn't be able to tell. um, i pulled a lot of influence for this this world from gent which hathellier, madoca magica and magus of the library and so you a lot of things would seem very familiar if you know those things. i ain't listen, listen. it's not like anybody'll really be seeing my world or anything. and by that time if people do i'll have i'll have it more flesh up. but yes, yes, they're called the celestials, right and after the celestials came and they stopped the fighting and so on, they were like, listen, we don't want to be like the old gods where we're here and we're governing you and we're causing all this conflict and whatever. we're going we're going to leave you all alone. all right, we're going to go to, like, the celestial realm which is right above like the sky of this planet like right there, like is right above, yet. we're going to go there and we're going to lay all govern yourself essentially. we're going to appoint four leaders, right and we're going to in our steed in our absence, these four leaders are going to be like your your kings or whatever. i don't even know your monarchs, right, and we're going to decide, uh, how the planet is and all of that and like if you have any grievances or wherever you go to them, but we don't like intercept every now and then to make sure everything is good and everything is chill and all right. but at the end of the day, you'll are responsible for you all planet, you'll do whatever you all want with it. peace and they left and oh, before they left. they gifted humanity magic. we can get into the magic system a bit later. but yes, so they left and they left the celestines to rule in their steed, right. and so the celestines there were four celestines, one for each celestial and they essentially divided the planet up into before, um, each part was overseen by a celestial and each celestial would appoint high lords in those regions to watch over the regions with them to like the celestians watched over the end was in charge of the region. no, okay, so they were in charge of the entire world, basically, right, but they had their four regions that they were supposed to focus on. but because they had a lot of stuff to do, they would appoint high lords who would also kind of like how the celestials love the celestines, they left the high lord to watch over that region for them, right, and each high lord would report to a celestine and then high lords would appoint magistrates or governors to watch over like smaller parts of that region. so it was like a whole system of like governance going on down there we can also get into that of it later, right. so these regions, um, not of the old gods and so on have been sealed. there's like there's a lot more peace happening. people are living in a lot more harmony. of course you still have the like disharmonious people. i don't know if it baseline. there are they're still people that sow like disharmony and so on in the regions, you know, they're still racial discrimination and and all of that happening, um but overall they're they're a lot more peace the celestines try their best to keep order in the country if people have if there's places that have a lot of like chaos and dispatch stuff happening, they try to resolve that because they really don't want another like, you know, like in the ancient times where it was just like they don't want that to happen again, right so they they kind of want order. but they're also loky kinda corrupted because with wanting order they basically forced, um, people to follow like this one main religion, they forced them to, um, follow their rules and all of that. so while it is kind of, um, benefiting people like there is peace and well, mostly peace, mostly prosperity. you know, there are still people that don't agree with the celestines and all that are but yet, the celestines are all s they're a little bit corrupt, right and they're there's there's some corruption happening in this world. of course there is 'cause we need conflict and a peaceful world is just boring. we gotta we gotta get a little conflict and all, right, right. so onto the magic, right, because that was that was just like some context for iridia itself. that was just some like back story. still gotta like going to like the natigrity of iridian all. anyway, so the magic system, right. so i wanted this magic system to be kind of unique, um hold on okay. i gotta open an odd document for that"

        "hyp": " right. so the magic system. this so this is kind of tricky. i don't have it completely flushed out yet, but the one thing i knew going into making this magic system was i wanted it to be based on the concept of karma right, your karmic destiny. the amount of power that you have in this world would be based on your karmic destiny, right. so you know the basics of karma, right. um, it means that your your past actions, um, in past, uh, life times or whatever, they all influence your future, right your future or your presence, so your past actions influence your current life, your future lifestyle and all of that jobs, right. so in this world it follows the same basic concept so you have your karmic destiny, your karmic weight and it represents a spiritual and metaphysical impact that you have on the world, right. so your powers are basically influenced by your ambitions, by your actions, by your past actions in some sense. i'm not i'm not entirely sure if i want to have reincarnation as a concept in this world. um, it would kind of make sense if we're going to karmic though to have reincarnation but i'm not sure i i'm not so sure how reincarnation would work in this world considering i haven't developed like a heaven and hell or anything like that yet. we're going to see we're going to see. i know that people in the world believe in reincarnation. but is reincarnation actually a thing i don't know yet. i'll i'll i'll eventually get there anyway, so your magic is influenced by your karmic wit, so the magic itself was given as gift to the humans from the celestials, right. the integrity of that i'm not really sure. um, i keep saying i'm not really short, but there's a lot of stuff that i haven't really flushed out that much yet, um especially 'cause it's so like it's so much, it's so complex. i want the magic system to be one that's fully flushed out to be one that that no matter what question you have it can't be answered by the magic system, right. so the magic was given to the people by the celestials and people who can use this magic are referred to as eathers or eater borns and only a very small percentage help the people in a radia can actually use magic is not not everybody could actually use it. it's not you wake up one day like, oh, no. there's only a very, very small percentage of people that can use magic and it's like that because of your because it's influenced by your karmic with karmic desney because less honestly you not everyone is going to have a huge influence on the world. not everyone is going to be highly ambitious, not everyone is going to have got that change, um, that you want to see in the world right, it's going to be a small amount of people, right. so that's why there's only a very like a small percentage of people that actually can use magic, even though everyone benefits from the magic. like in a technical sense there is technology powered by magic in the world. so non ethers can't use magic, but they can't produce that magic themselves if you get what i'm saying. right. so there's a small potential of people that can actually abuse magic, but there is still a lot of ethers scatter throughout the world of rudia, right because like well one percent of eight billion is still like a hundred million a sum. i don't know. i don't you're the mass person, i don't know match. you know the answer to that anyways, right. so, the magic itself powered by karmic destiny. magic use in iridia is governed by the celestine council which in turn is run by the celestines. and while there is no strict laws and restrictions that govern the general use of magic, the council still keeps a close eye on magic users, especially if you are a magic user of a higher round so. within ether bornes there are different ranks of them because you could have a small percentage of magic or you could have a high percentage of massive because again, your power is based on your influence, on your actions, on your ambitions and all of us. if you're a highly ambitious person who is going to have a huge influence on the world, then you're going to be extremely strong, right. and of course the council, the celestines are going to want to keep an eye on you, 'cause what do you mean you're very ambitious. what do you mean you're going to have like this huge change in the world. we got it we want to know what that means, right. i also wanted it to have like when i first came up with this world, one thing that i also wanted was the concept of ascension where a person who has this magic. if they are powerful enough they can eventually ascend and become a celestine. i'm not sure if i'm going to keep that though, 'cause that's like really true. that's still like that's a really tricky concept because if you can become a celestine, that means that the celestines die, right. so that means the celestes are in a sense mortal, right. and if the celestines are mortal, what kind of beings really are the celestines. you know what i mean, like where do they come from how are they dying. actually, i don't think i even have to answer those questions. yeah. i don't have to answer you know what i'm not going to answer it. i've just i'm just going to keep it up in the air an air of mystery, so i might actually bring back the ascension 'cause i really liked i really like that whole concept of being able to ascend and eventually become, um, a celestial if you're powerful enough and all of that. um, but yes, so they are like the ether bars who can use magic, but they are also the bad people. these are people called foid mages. so void mages do not fuck with celestials at all. they don't like the celestials. i think the celestials are a fraud because what do you mean you gifted us magic. where is the magic coming from, right? oh another thing a very important thing that i forgot to mention about the magic is when you use the the magic, um when you die, right, your energy is harvested for use by the celestials. that's like a big, big thing with the magic. that was like one of the first things i thought of when i came up with the magic system, i don't know how i how i forgot to mention it, but yet so when you die when you're there's energy that's released upon your death and that energy is consumed by the celestial. so the stronger your karmic weight is, the more energy you produce upon death, right? and i think that would also tighten to the reincarnation thing now that i think about it because if this energy is being consumed by the celestials, then that means your soul can't even really die, right, you'd have to have to reincarnate or something along those lines. i'll i'll think about it later, but yet to the celestians consume this energy. but it can also be used by void magicis. so when you die the void magicis can intercept the whole process and steal some of that energy from the dead person, which makes floyd maches very dangerous, right. the void majors don't really like the celestials, like i mentioned before. they are worshippers of the old gods. they believe that the celestials are in the wrong. they believe that celestials are hiding something, 'cause why did the celestial seal the gods away instead of killing them, how did the celestial steal the gods away. we don't know. we do know that they are gods that are able to, um, speak with humans even from the nether realms and they're able to send humans messages and so on and those humans usually become voyd natures, stuff like that, right. uh going back to magic use and it being kind of bad, the more magic that you use as an ether, the more side effects it has on your body. prolonged exposure to the magic can cause a person's mind and body to slowly decay and corrupt. that is crazy. that is so crazy. like the higher level of magic user that you are, the more corrupt your body can become and they usually experience stuff like swift personalities or time distortions. the time disorting thing is really cool, 'cause okay, so i don't think did you watch shows what is it called hold on, hold on. right. so in out of the all along there is this character called lilia. lilia experiences time distortions or i think she does. that's what i think she it seems to me that she discovered this she experiences time disorces. so lilia's life she hasn't experienced her life linearly. she has moments where her mind jumps to different parts of her her life so one minute she's like five years old. the next minute she's old, she's in her like thirties or forties and she doesn't like remember what she was doing before. so, like, if she let's say you're you're hair, like, time is linear, it's on a line. your you know, like time usually is or how people perceive time to be. she's at one end of the line and then suddenly she's at the beginning and she doesn't even really know what happened. she doesn't know how it happens. she doesn't remember that time jump or anything like that. so people usually view lilia as crazy because they don't understand how her power works and she doesn't even really understand how it worked. um, but that's what i that's what i imagine when i say pe they experience time disortions. they have periods of times that they're just completely absent and then they come back and they don't remember what was going on. it seem like they were just a completely different person, there's something along that lines, right. so, the more magic if you use, the more it can decay your mind and dekay your body. sometimes you can even like distort your actual appearance, like it could cause your, like, hands to become pitch black or it could cause you to grow extra limbs or horns or eyes or like all of these different crazy things, right. so using magic is inherently dangerous. people still use it though, 'cause i mean it's magic, right. um but yes, so there are different types of magic users and there are different ranks of magic users. like i like i said before, i still have to come up with, like, names for the ranks. it's like well, this thing is so much work i want it to be so flushed out and so detailed, but also it's it's a lot of work to, like, sit down and think up of these things and like write them down and all that 'cause i don't write them down, then i'm going to forget and all and that's like a lot but but it will be worth it because i will be using this as inspiration for my art and so on. like, i'm going to draw random people from the world and it's going to make sense because they're from somewhere, um, and it'll also help with, like, world building stuff and all of that. um yes, so yeah, i i've i've been really busy with this world, um there's still a lot that i have to do in terms of flushing stuff out making. i haven't made any characters for it as yet, uh, because i listen, i lost my apple pencil. yeah, i did. it was the same thing that we went unusually to make puffs. i dropped it somewhere, i guess unusually complex and that was the end of that, right. um, so i have to get a new apple pencil and until i get a new apple pencil i can't really do that much art. i'm trying to do art look like my regular pencil and my sketch by but kind of songs. like i miss i miss my tablet. i miss drawing on my tablet, you know. um but i still i'm still doing the traditional art because i mean, i guess i have to i have to learn it, right, at some point, like i have to know how to draw traditionally anyway, so it's good practice. um, but yet, when i get about my ample pension then i deal a bit more into, like, the art and i could start, um some game design and so once i wanna make a game very soon. i don't even know how i'm going to do it 'cause he stressed me out. i have a lot to do i got a test on thursday that i need to study for and then i have the bridge competition coming up that i haven't even started practicing for yet and then i have, like, dance practices on sundays, i have the club stuff that i'm doing, it's just it's just a lot, man. i'm tired, you don't know. i don't know why i'm going to have time to really focus on this portfolio, but i really should focus on it because it's very important and if i don't have a portfolio by the time i finish uchie then i'm basically fuck because i can't apply for any colleges or anything like that and i wanna i wanna go straight from uchie to do with my masters at an audient university. that is the plan, but we'll we'll see how that goes, we'll see how that goes"

        "hyp": " when she was fourteen years old, lois went on a canoe trip. she had only been on overnights before. this was to be a long one, into the trackless wilderness as kappie put it. it was lois's first canoe trip on her last. copy was the head of the summer comp to which louis had been sent ever since she was nine. camp manitu it was called. it was one of the better ones for girls, though not the best. girls of herage whose parents could afford it were routinely pocked off to such comps which bore a generic resemblance to one another. they favored indian nymphs and hot hearty, energetic leaders who were called copy, skip or scottie. at these comps he learned to swim well and sail and paddle a canoe, and perhaps ride a horse or play tennis. when he weren't doing these things he would do arks on crafts and turno, dingy, lumpish clay ash trays for your mother mother smoked more back then, or bracelets made of coloured braided string. cheerfulness was required at all times even at breakfast. loat shouting and buying of spoons on the table were a load, and even encouraged at ritual intervals. chocolate bars were rationed to control tooth degant pimples. at night after supper in the dining hall or outside around the mosquito invested camp fire ring for special treats, they were singing songs. louis can still remember all the lyrics to my darling clementine and to my bonny lies over the ocean, while with acting old gestures, a rippling of the hands for the ocean, two hands together under the cheek for lies. she will never be able to forget them, which is a sad thought. louis thinks she can recognize women who went to these comps and who were good at it. they have a hardness to their hand shakes, even though a way of standing, legs planted firmly apart further than usual a way of sizing you up to see if you'd be any good in a canoe the front, not the back. they themselves would be in the back they would call it the stern. she knows that such comps still exist, also although camp manitou does not. they are one of the few things that haven't changed much. they now offer copper enomelling and functionless pieces of stained glass broken into electric ovens. though judging from the productions of her friend's grandchildren, their artistic standards have not improved. to louis, encountering it in the first year after the war camp manitou seemed almost ancient. its log sided buildings with the white cement in between the half logs, its flock pole ringed with whitewash stones, its weathered grey dock jutting out into late prospect, with its wooden rope bumpers and its rusty rings for tying up its prim rowned floor bed of petunias near the office door must surely have been there always. in truth it dated only from the first decade of the century. it had been founded by koppi's parents who thought of comping as bracing to the character, like cold showers and had been passed along to her as an inheritance and an obligation. louis later realized that it must have been a struggle for koppi to keep companitude going during the depression and then during the war when money did not flow freely. if it had been a comp for the very rich instead of the merely well off, there would have been fewer problems. but there must have been enough old girls, ones with daughters to keep the thing in operation, though not entirely ship shaped. further, furniture was battered, painted, trim was peeling, roofs leaked there were dim photographs of these old girls dotted around the dining hall wearing ample woollen bathing suits and showing off their fat dimpled legs, or standing arms intertwined in odd tennis outfits with boggy skirts."
